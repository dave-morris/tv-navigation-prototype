"large": "A dead man is found on waste ground in Pennsylvania 2013. He had been stabbed twenty-two times. The 42-year-old municipal worker, Troy LaFerarra, had answered an Internet ad from 18-year old Miranda Barbour and they had arranged to meet.\n\n \n\nThree weeks later Miranda confesses she’d killed him in self-defense. But local Sunbury police officer, Travis Bremigen, suspects the young wife has something to hide. He brings Miranda’s husband, Elytte Barbour, in for questioning. The 22-year-old admits he and his new wife just wanted to murder a stranger, “We had no reason… other than that.”\n\n \n\nHeadlines brand them \"The Craigslist Thrill Killlers\". While awaiting trial, Miranda makes an astonishing confession to a local reporter that Troy was not her first victim. She tells Francis Scarcella she’d killed more than 22 others as part of a Satanic murder cult that began in Alaska. The resulting headlines about a Satanic teen serial killer rocked the world.\n\n \n\nElytte Barbour also reveals to officer Bremigen that the newly weds would cut each other, “having sexual intercourse in their own blood”. Elytte firmly believes that his wife is \"demon possessed\".\n\n \n\nIn Alaska, where Miranda was brought up, local journalist Jill Burke believes there must be more to this story than than the lurid headlines. Digging deep into Miranda's past, Jill uncovers dark secrets about her upbringing and her complex history. Do these hold the key to explaining Miranda's apparent \"thrill kill\" and her claims to have murdered many more people?",

Sergi tests out his latest robot and James finds out how Maritsa copes with Sergi using the dolls himself.\n\n\n\nElsewhere in Barcelona James also finds simple versions of the robots - not yet fitted with AI - being used in a brothel, and visits a professional sex toy tester who tries out one of the latest male sex dolls to hit the market.\n\n\n\nBack in the UK, James visits Sergi’s business partner Arran who has been demo’ing a Samantha robot in a sex shop near Liverpool. Arran tells James about his latest plan - to offer his sex robots to elderly people’s homes.\n\n\n\nIn Japan, James meets two of the most human-like robots to have been created before discovering a darker side to the sex robot industry when he visits a factory mass-producing ultra-realistic dolls.\n\n\n\nSo do we really want sex robots in our lives?",

The programme follows a specialist pathology team as they conduct a post-mortem on the body of a 17-stone woman whose body was donated to medical science. Their findings, as they dissect the body and its organs, are startling, exposing the devastating impact of obesity with stunning visuals and fascinating medical facts.\n\nMorbid obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of nine years and is blamed for over 30,000 deaths in the UK every year. With 65 per cent of people already overweight or obese, this extraordinary film is a powerful contribution to the debate about fat, food, lifestyle and how the health service will cope with the growing obesity crisis.",
