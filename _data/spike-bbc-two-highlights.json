Not the kind of thing Syedr makes public information. Finally, Borlu and Dhatt come face-to-face with Bowden. Borlu wants to know about Bowden's relationship with Mahalia - he sees him as a key suspect. Bowden says he had an argument with Mahalia on the night she went missing. It looks like anyone with a connection to Orciny is under threat. Bowden remembers where he's seen Borlu before - Katrynia had time for his theories.\n\nBorlu and Dhatt head to Bowden's apartment. It's been ransacked, covered with the same glyphs that Borlu saw in the cave, and now Bowden has gone missing.",

Since then they have had to adapt rapidly to the ways of the outside world. Writer and adventurer Will Millard visits the Korowai four times over the course of a year, to see if he can get closer to them than is usually possible, to better understand the pressures they face as they leave the forest behind and transition into the modern world. He also wants to find out how much of their traditional hunter-gathering lifestyle still exists. What he finds shocks, surprises and confounds him, as he witnesses the last gasp of an ancient way of life which once defined us all.\n\nWill returns for his second trip to the Korowai to spend more time with Haup (White Beard) and Halap. They are some of the last remaining Korowai still living permanently in a treehouse without any real contact with the outside world. When Will first meets them, their adopted son August is there with them in the forest and his wife Amel gives birth one night, cutting her own umbilical cord with a sharpened piece of wood. But it soon turns out that they spend most of their time in the government-sponsored villages six hours walk away, and have decided to come to the treehouse to see if they can work with the film crew. So Will asks them to return to their government-built village, preparing to spend 10 days living with Haup and Halap alone in the middle of the forest.",

Gillian is a scientist from West Yorkshire, and is a goat's cheese purist. She makes unpasteurised goat's cheese from her own herd, putting 40 hours a week into her small-scale business alongside her day job. But with goat's cheese being an acquired taste, will the Malhamdale locals think it is worth it?\n\nPedro lives in Oxfordshire and keeps his beloved goat Rosie in his back garden. With Rosie's help, he makes flavoured goat's cheese, but with such a small operation, does he have what it takes to become a viable business? Alongside her day job and running her B&B, Jo makes cheddar cheese in the Welsh countryside. She loves using milk from her local cows and is passionate about the cheesemaking process, but when it comes to selling in the shop, she must tone down the details and dial up the flavour if she's going to succeed.\n\nFinally, information governance adviser Julie from Hampshire makes a homemade smoked cheese after her daughter fell in love with the flavours. She does everything from a kitchen at home and hasn't sold commercially before, so whether she has what it takes remains to be seen.\n\nTom Kerridge meets members of the community as they try the range of cheeses. Meanwhile judges Alison Swan Parente and Nisha Katona visit the food producers at home to see how well their product is made, and decide how well they promote and sell their item to the Yorkshire locals in the shop. The winner is the fledgling business that is most viable and most deserving of the title best up and coming artisan.",

      "large": "On most days in winter, the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Queen's Medical Centre is full. Intensive care is often the last resort for very sick children, a place that can keep them alive while doctors work on making them better. It's also where children undergoing the most serious surgery come to recuperate. It's the job of Lead Consultant Paediatrician Patrick Davies to balance the ever increasing demands that are made on the over-flowing unit every day 'We're stretched to breaking point. One patient in, one patient out. There is a queue of patients around the region waiting for our beds'.\n\nLack of children's intensive care beds is a nationwide problem. Four-year-old Esme is rushed to Queens Medical Centre from Hull, 90 miles away, when her closest intensive care units in Leeds and Sheffield are both completely full. She is suffering from septic shock, an extreme form of sepsis, a life threatening condition that occurs when the body reacts to an infection by damaging its own organs. Patrick and the team must first stabilise her so that her life is out of danger. But the sepsis still threatens Esme's limbs and the team must now battle to save her fingers and toes.\n\n22-month-old Amaya has contracted pneumonia on both lungs. Patrick believes her situation is extremely grave and he informs her mum Mel and dad Karl that he can't be sure she will pull through. Patrick battles to restore the oxygen levels in her lungs - the one thing that can save her life. This is not Amaya's first time in intensive care. Born very prematurely at 24 weeks, Amaya has spent 10 of her 22 months in hospital. While doctors are having ever greater success in keeping premature babies alive, those children will often return to intensive care time and time again, further increasing pressure on beds.\n\n14-year-old Ella needs an intensive care bed to recover from major spinal surgery. She's been cancelled before due to a lack of beds in the unit and on the day of her re-scheduled operation it is completely full yet again. She waits on the ward, not knowing whether her life-changing operation will take place, while staff do everything they can to find her a bed.",
