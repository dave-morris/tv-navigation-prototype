Toodloo and Great BigHoo look around for Chickedy and Chick and see them moving around under the bed covers. They join them and, not being able to see where they are going, they run off the end of the bed, pulling the duvet down with them. They snuggle up in the soft duvet but are interrupted by the cat returning. The Hooter calls them home just as the cat jumps onto the duvet and so the lady returns to find the duvet on the floor at the foot of the bed, with the cat curled up on top of it.\n\nThe Box visits the boat and this time it is filled with soft balls of fluff, which float around the boat and settle on the floor. The Twirlywoos pile them up into a soft nest and settle down to sleep. Meanwhile, a piece of fluff finds its way into Peekaboo's house. It makes him sneeze, which blows all the fluff into the air, and the Twirlywoos wake up and collect it all up again - only for Peekaboo to sneeze it away again! The final time, Peekaboo sneezes so much that he blows all the fluff right out of the door.",
