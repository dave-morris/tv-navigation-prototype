Investigative journalist Ellie Flynn goes undercover to get a closer look at this issue.\n\nHaving seen the staggering amount of 'rent for sex' adverts that appear unchecked online, Ellie heads out to discover for herself just how genuine these ads are. Armed with undercover cameras, she meets landlords who post these ads to find out what they really expect in exchange for rent.\n\nThe landlords she confronts protest that it is a mutually beneficial arrangement. One tells her she can stay in a log cabin he has built in exchange for a 'physical arrangement once a week', stating that it's 'nothing abnormal, nothing strange' and telling her she has to be able to deal with that or\nshe shouldn't be there. Another tells her the arrangement would be every second day. She finds people all over the UK offering accommodation in exchange for sex, one even saying the reason the room has become available is because it belongs to his daughter and she's left to go to university. A prospective landlord also tells her he's taking the human aspect out of it and treating it like a business transaction, while others assure her they're just normal guys who just want to help people.\n\nAll the landlords suggest to Ellie that what they're doing is acceptable, but is this how the person taking up the offer would see it? Can it really be consensual when they are preying on vulnerable young people with nowhere else to go? To find out she tracks down and speaks to young women who have taken up these arrangements and asks them how much consent they felt able to give when the alternative was a life on the streets.\n\nDespite laws that exist to criminalise this practice, Ellie asks why there doesn't seem to be anyone doing anything to prevent it. From police forces to the Ministry of Justice, she uncovers a vacuum of responsibility that currently exists.",

There are countless reasons why some students do well academically and others don't, but experts agree that parental influence is one of the main factors that can affect a student's performance in school. In a groundbreaking experiment, this programme will put that to the test.\n\nChessington Community College in Greater London, like all schools, has some students who excel and others who are failing to make the grade. In an attempt to change the paths of two of their students the school have decided to embark on a radical experiment. Like many teenagers, Year 11 students Jack and Hollie struggle with results and behaviour but with their crucial GCSEs on the horizon it is time to try and change things. In order to do this they will move into the homes of two of the highest achieving pupils in their year, for half a term. Can this complete change in home environment improve things for them?\n\nHollie moves in with Holly H, a wannabe lawyer with a clutch of A*s in her sights and a dizzying rota of extra-curricular activities. Jack goes to live with Tharush, who arrived in the UK only a year ago from Italy but is already shining at school. Tharush's work efforts are exceptional - he does at least two hours homework every night, and that is on top of extra tuition.\n\nHow will Hollie and Jack cope as they have to fit into every aspect of their new families' lives, living by their strict rules and routines? As they wrestle with the early bedtimes, tough homework schedules and curfews, can this revolutionary change in family life bring about a lasting change in their results and futures?",

Arran tells James about his latest plan - to offer his sex robots to elderly people’s homes.\n\n\n\nIn Japan, James meets two of the most human-like robots to have been created before discovering a darker side to the sex robot industry when he visits a factory mass-producing ultra-realistic dolls.\n\n\n\nSo do we really want sex robots in our lives?",
