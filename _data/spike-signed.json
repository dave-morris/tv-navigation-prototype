Because of it, his parents were able to move to Dudley from Jamaica in the 1950s, putting Lenny on the path to fame and fortune in the UK. Lenny examines the deep-rooted and complicated connection between the Caribbean and Great Britain, and the role the Commonwealth plays in this relationship. Where did this organisation, made up of 53 countries and 2,3 billion people, come from? How can it survive its legacy of empire and slavery? Does it have any role in the 21st century?\n\nLenny sets off on a tour into the body, mind and soul of the Caribbean, to investigate the experiences of those who live so far from the UK but remain members of this vast and populous club. He travels back to Jamaica to investigate his own beginnings and finds out why, 60 years ago, his mother uprooted the family to travel thousands of miles to the rainy Midlands. He meets his older brother Seymour for a tour of the remote and rural plot he would have called home if the Henrys had remained on the island. He visits a lush rum plantation in an attempt to understand what life was like for his ancestors - African slaves brought to the Caribbean against their will. Lenny spends time with Commonwealth champion Rasheed Dwyer and Olympian Sashalee Forbes, and hangs out at a Chronixx gig to hear what importance, if any, the Commonwealth has to Jamaicans today.\n\nIn Antigua, Lenny traces the roots of why the British ended up in the Caribbean in the first place and meets some of the expats who have decided to make the Caribbean their home. Finally he travels to Barbuda to visit the island community devastated by Hurricane Irma, to hear tragic tales from survivors and consider the role the Commonwealth could play in the future around the world.\n\nMeeting a collection of real people along the way - street vendors and historians, teachers and students, entrepreneurs and politicians, as well as members of his own family - Lenny examines the special bond that exists between the people of the Caribbean and the UK, a microcosm of the wider relationship between all of the people of the Commonwealth.",

As his health declined in these final years, Picasso faced damaging criticism of his work and intimate revelations about his bohemian lifestyle for the first time. And yet, in the midst of disaster, he rediscovered his revolutionary spirit with a creative surge that produced some of his most sexually frank and comic work. Exhibitions of the new style horrified and disappointed contemporaries. But now his biographer Sir John Richardson and granddaughter Diana Widmaier Picasso argue that this last enormous effort produced some of his greatest and most profound art: the stunning counter-attack of a protean genius coming to terms with old age.",

      "large": "Think Renaissance and you think of Italy. But in the 15th and 16th centuries, the great Islamic empires experienced their own extraordinary cultural flowering. The two phenomena did not unfold in separate artistic universes - they were acutely conscious of, and in competition with, each other and mutually open to influences flowing both ways. The fifth film in Civilisations goes east and west with Simon Schama - to Papal Rome, but also to Ottoman Istanbul and Mughal Lahore and Agra, exploring those connections and rivalries, and examining how the role of artists from the different traditions of west and east developed in the years that followed the Renaissances.\n\nThat rivalry unfolds most spectacularly over the creation of domes - in Ottoman Istanbul the great engineer-architect Mimar Sinan builds the light-flooded Suleymaniye Mosque, while at the same time in Rome, Michelangelo designed the great dome over the St Peter's Basilica. The fate of the hero-artist, seemingly touched by God, with the gift of making visual miracles, henceforth diverged in the east and west. In Europe, as the century turned, artists such as Benvenuto Cellini, with his sculpture of Perseus with the Head of Medusa, could lay claim to sovereignty over the world of art. The greatest European artists like Caravaggio, Velasquez and Rembrandt shook off decorum and turned muscular, earthy and theatrical. Meanwhile in the east, Mughal art, still capable of acts of breathtaking architectural and painterly beauty, as expressed in mausoleums like the I'timad-ud-Daulah and gorgeous miniature paintings, became ever more refined, poetic and exquisite.",

They reveal a story of robbery, murder and a potential miscarriage of justice.\n\nOn Friday 18 March 1910, 44-year-old John Nisbet boarded a 10.27am train from Newcastle Central Station. By the time the train reached the end of the line, he was dead. He had been shot five times, his bag, containing £370 in cash, had been stolen, and his body had been stuffed beneath the carriage seats. Local bookmaker John Dickman was convicted of his murder and sentenced to death, but he always protested his innocence.\n\nNow, over 100 years later, his great-grandson Rowan is on a mission to find out the truth. Rowan enlists the help of Sasha and Jeremy, who retrace the steps that John Dickman took on that fateful day, and they work together get to the bottom of this notorious case. Was John Dickman really responsible for this brutal crime? Or was he the victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice? And will the team find enough new evidence to present the case to a Crown Court judge?",

Despite his loss, just 18 months later Patrick was taking to the stand-up stage in Belfast, forging a comedy career by telling jokes about life in what felt like a warzone.\n\nYear after year, the sectarian killings continued. Then in 1998, along with the majority of the Northern Irish population, Patrick voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement. It meant those convicted over his dad's murder would be released from prison, but it brought a promise of peace after 30 years of conflict, with the potential to build a new society based on reconciliation.\n\nNow, on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, Patrick wants to find out if the historic peace deal has delivered on its pledge to create a new Northern Ireland, free of the hatred that took Jack Kielty's life.\n\nPatrick returns to his home village of Dundrum, where his dad was killed, and then travels around Northern Ireland meeting other people whose lives were shattered by the Troubles. He confronts those responsible for committing acts of violence on both sides, asking why they became radicalised by the bloodshed and why some still seem to be wedded to their weapons. Patrick also meets other people caught up in the conflict, including Richard Moore, who was a ten-year-old boy on his way home from school when he was shot and blinded by a British army officer's rubber bullet. He wants to know whether it's possible for victims to be reconciled to a peaceful life alongside those who hurt them.\n\nPatrick visits the border country, exploring why Brexit has put the peace deal back in the spotlight, and meets politicians from both sides. Hearing their personal stories of how their families were also caught up in the conflict, he asks DUP leader Arlene Foster and a young Sinn Fein representative, Emma Rogan, why the power-sharing government between nationalists and unionists, a key part of the agreement, has collapsed.\n\nFinally, Patrick returns to Dundrum and asks young people, Catholics and Protestants who attend one of the Province's integrated schools, where they feel Northern Ireland is headed.",

David shows the growing ambivalence with which artists reacted to the idea of progress, both intellectual and scientific, that underpinned the imperial mission and followed the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution.\n\nAdvances in knowledge and technology imbued Europeans in the 19th century with a sense of their civilisation's superiority. It justified their imperial ideology. But it created among artists deep fascinations with other civilisations which in turn produced a scepticism about their own. By contrast, as European artists questioned their civilisation's 'advance', in America painters sought to capture an idea of their new nation's 'manifest destiny' in landscapes. And in their representation of the Native Americans, they sought to record for posterity the world and the cultures they were violently displacing. But this was not always the case. David show how in New Zealand one artist was co-opted by the Maori who used his sills to record their culture and celebrate their ancestors. As the 19th century came to an end, the certainties of industrial and scientific advance were increasingly questioned - many artists (Gauguin and Picasso amongst them) turned to non-Western art and culture for inspiration. And in the face of the catastrophic conflict of the First World War, the idea that progress, reason and industrial advance were guarantors of higher 'civilisation' was rejected. David ends the film with a powerful meditation on Otto Dix's nightmarish and ironic evocation of the horror of the trenches, the triptych Der Krieg (The War).",

And, as historian of empire David Olusoga shows, art was always on the frontline. Each cultural contact at this time left a mark on both sides: the magnificent Benin bronzes record the meeting of an ancient West African kingdom and Portuguese voyagers in a spirit of mutual respect and exchange. By contrast we think Spain's conquest of Central America in the 16th century as decimating the Aztecs and eviscerating their culture. But David shows even in Mexico rare surviving Aztec artworks recall a more nuanced story. He travels to Japan to explore how the Tokugawa Shogunate, after an initial embrace, became so wary of outside interference that they sought to cut ties with the outside world. But in their art, as in their trade, they could never truly isolate themselves from foreign influences. By contrast the Protestant Dutch Republic was itself an entirely new kind of creature: a market driven nation-state. It was a system that created new freedoms and opportunities as embodied in the world-infused art of Johannes Vermeer, or the watercolours of the naturalist and illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian. David ends with the transitional story of the British in India: at first the British were as open to foreign influence as the Dutch. But by the 1800s they became more aggressive and the era of encounters gave way to the era of muscular empire, that was dismissive of India's arts and cultures.",

Whilst the sages' words are beamed live right into their ear day and night, family, friends and colleagues remain totally unaware of these unseen secret helpers. As the Brits face challenges and dilemmas, the sages tell them exactly what they think in real time, offering tips, advice and home-grown perspectives on life, love and everything in between.\n \nVia the wonders of modern technology, an Irish nun, a traditional healer and her friend from South Africa, a couple of retired cops from New York, two Italian mamas and a Norwegian health guru watch the person live going about their week and hand-hold them towards their significant event, whether it is a wedding, the first week of fatherhood or a new business launch. \n \nIn the first episode, it's Dan and Brett's turn to prove themselves with the help of the secret friends. Dan, 32, used to be a gregarious, motorbike riding salesman with the world at his feet. After suffering two massive strokes, he was left blind and unable to walk, and his girlfriend Suzy has spent the last year helping him to regain his sight, speech and mobility. \n \nAlthough he may look like someone who has fully recovered, when he pushes himself too hard he gets migraines, cannot walk and gets aches and pains down the left side of his body. He also gets anxious when faced with large crowds of people. With a week to go to their wedding, Dan is desperate to support Suzy, but he is worried that if he pushes himself too hard he won't make it to the altar. Dan needs all the help he can get from the sages in the lead-up to the most important day of his life. Will Suzy discover she has unusual guests at her big day?\n \nBrett is a first-time parent. He and his wife Jess have just brought their identical twins home from the hospital. They are exhausted from a scary pregnancy fraught with medical complications. It is not long before he is secretly getting instructions from the secret helpers and is impressing his wife with burping techniques, home-cooked meals and South African lullabies. Brett wants to learn to be a dad who fully supports his wife and will help settle the twins before he returns to work. \n \nThe sages are Gwen and Elisa from South Africa, italian mamas Chiara and Agata, Mark and Joe the New York cops, Sister Una from Ireland and health guru Lillian from Norway.",
