With only six weeks until judging day they have come up an ambitious grand plan to impress the judges but rallying a community that has been through a difficult time is a huge ask. Their key projects this year include an ambitious challenge to transform an overgrown school garden, a village makeover which will involve the whole community and a show-stopping garden in a local pub. The local economy depends on visitors and the Bloomers hope a gold will help draw people to the village, so there is a lot at stake.",

Headed up by the communities from the Sikh temple and the local church, this group have few funds so they are relying on the wider community to donate all the plants they will need. They want to impress the judges with three key projects: to fill the grounds of the temple and church with flowers, and to transform a neglected space in the community centre into a colourful garden for toddlers. But without a plan or planting scheme, gold will be hard to achieve.",

Their unconventional grand plan involves building a row of large, colourful pieces at the entrance to the town, including a three-metre-high helter-skelter and a dalek! The local centre for adults with learning disabilities is creating a show-stopping garden to impress the judges, and finally the Bloomers ask the whole community to join in and brighten up the promenade. These Bloomers take pride in doing things differently in Mablethorpe - but they only have seven weeks to get everything ready for judging.",
