Andy Day takes on the fantastical Shakespearean role of the island monster Caliban, while Justin Fletcher is the king's comical jester, Trinculo. With Patrick Robinson as Prospero and Annette Badland as his good friend Gonzala, CBeebies The Tempest brings together an amazing cast to perform one of Shakespeare's best-loved plays. \n\nSet on an island not far from Italy, the play tells the story of Prospero, one-time Duke of Milan, who lives with his daughter Miranda, their monster servant Caliban and a magical, musical and mostly invisible sprite called Ariel. Having been sent away from Milan 12 years earlier by his own brother Sebastian and King Alonso, Prospero has spent his time on the island practising his magic, studying and plotting for a time when he can take revenge. That moment has arrived. All his enemies are aboard a ship sailing near the island and it is the perfect time for Prospero's plan.\n\nCreating a magical storm with his sprite Ariel, Prospero causes a shipwreck, landing the king and his lords, ladies, butler and jester all over the island. Slowly Prospero weaves his magic to fulfil his plan, with Ariel carrying out many of his tasks, before eventually forgiving all those who did him wrong.\n\nFilmed at the Lawrence Batley Theatre, Huddersfield, in front of a live invited audience, CBeebies The Tempest is the perfect introduction to Shakespeare for families and preschoolers, with the most famous moments from Shakespeare's original text surrounded by magic, music and mischief.",

Toodloo and Great BigHoo look around for Chickedy and Chick and see them moving around under the bed covers. They join them and, not being able to see where they are going, they run off the end of the bed, pulling the duvet down with them. They snuggle up in the soft duvet but are interrupted by the cat returning. The Hooter calls them home just as the cat jumps onto the duvet and so the lady returns to find the duvet on the floor at the foot of the bed, with the cat curled up on top of it.\n\nThe Box visits the boat and this time it is filled with soft balls of fluff, which float around the boat and settle on the floor. The Twirlywoos pile them up into a soft nest and settle down to sleep. Meanwhile, a piece of fluff finds its way into Peekaboo's house. It makes him sneeze, which blows all the fluff into the air, and the Twirlywoos wake up and collect it all up again - only for Peekaboo to sneeze it away again! The final time, Peekaboo sneezes so much that he blows all the fluff right out of the door.",
