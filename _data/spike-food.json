They start by showing how to prepare the feasts on a small scale before upscaling to feed hundreds at large cookouts.\n\nSam and Shauna's meaty smoke-and-fire bonanza continues as they visit Cefn Hengoed in the Rhymney Valley. They are there to celebrate the achievements of the Cefn Hengoed Majestics, a unique marching jazz band, by putting on a feast of barbecued chickens to feed the players and the community they support. With 100 people to feed, Sam and Shauna organise a spectacular cookout of grilled chicken in Alabama white barbecue sauce, hasselback potatoes, Louisiana macque choux and a rainbow slaw. Sam and Shauna have a week to teach the members of the band how to cook the dishes. They also have to make an enormous bespoke grill large enough to hold the chickens, and together with the community they build a massive firepit to cook them. Everyone gathers when it's all ready to eat the food and celebrate with their big cookout.",

They have two days in the shop to promote and sell their wares.\n\nThis time it is cheesemakers competing against each other for a place in the final. Gillian is a scientist from West Yorkshire, and is a goat's cheese purist. She makes unpasteurised goat's cheese from her own herd, putting 40 hours a week into her small-scale business alongside her day job. But with goat's cheese being an acquired taste, will the Malhamdale locals think it is worth it?\n\nPedro lives in Oxfordshire and keeps his beloved goat Rosie in his back garden. With Rosie's help, he makes flavoured goat's cheese, but with such a small operation, does he have what it takes to become a viable business? Alongside her day job and running her B&B, Jo makes cheddar cheese in the Welsh countryside. She loves using milk from her local cows and is passionate about the cheesemaking process, but when it comes to selling in the shop, she must tone down the details and dial up the flavour if she's going to succeed.\n\nFinally, information governance adviser Julie from Hampshire makes a homemade smoked cheese after her daughter fell in love with the flavours. She does everything from a kitchen at home and hasn't sold commercially before, so whether she has what it takes remains to be seen.\n\nTom Kerridge meets members of the community as they try the range of cheeses. Meanwhile judges Alison Swan Parente and Nisha Katona visit the food producers at home to see how well their product is made, and decide how well they promote and sell their item to the Yorkshire locals in the shop. The winner is the fledgling business that is most viable and most deserving of the title best up and coming artisan.",
