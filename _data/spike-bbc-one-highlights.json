Is she trying to tell her mother that one of the family is gay?\n\nWhen Dermot's pre-marriage nerves get the better of him, he does what he always does when stressed. He locks himself in the cupboard. Father Quinn is bemused to have to give Maria and Dermot their pre-marriage talk in slightly unusual circumstances - with the mother of the groom in attendance and the groom in the cupboard. If Dermot won't reappear for the priest, how on earth is Agnes going to persuade him to come out in time for his wedding? \n\nMeanwhile, Agnes Brown goes on a hunt for the homosexual in the family. Eventually she realises who it is. With help from Cathy and a greetings card, Agnes reassures them, and herself, as only she can.",

This week the challenge is to paint water and the many colours it reflects. \n\nWith the wind howling, in the first task they must try to mix the perfect colours to capture a boat and its stormy reflections in the turbulent water. Mentors Diana Ali and Pascal Anson, as always, are\non hand with hints and tips, which some of the artists choose to ignore at their peril. \n\nThe masterclasses this week are all about mixing colours. Armed with just the primary paints, our mentors have two techniques to help the artists see and mix colour more accurately. For the main\nchallenge, the painters move to a full, panoramic view of the loch, which is useful as that is exactly what the judges want to see on canvas. Can they capture the ever-changing colours of the sky, land and water, which at times disappear from view all together? No one said it would be easy. \n\nAt a viewing, the results are seen by members of the public, who decide on their favourite artist to be catapulted to the semi-final. The rest must await the verdict of the judges, Lachlan Goudie and Daphne Todd OBE. \n\nHosted by Mariella Frostrup and Rev Richard Coles, the search for the winner of the Big Painting Challenge 2018 starts to heat up.",

Although not by a well-known artist, they are a contemporary, eyewitness account of some of the First World War's most vicious dog-fights. Plus a belt buckle used on a nurse's uniform proves to be an exotic French creation worth thousands of pounds.\n\nSometimes, it's a collection that makes headlines. At Castle Howard, finds include a collection of highly-decorative snuff boxes and another of Welsh cycling medals, many of which are solid gold.\n\nFiona pits her wits against ceramic specialist Will Farmer to guess which of three items has increased in value over the 40 years that the Antiques Roadshow has been on air.

          "large": "Documentary exploring Sikh identity in modern Britain. Actor and comedian Sanjeev Kohli goes on a heartwarming personal journey to explore the importance of wearing the Sikh turban in Britain and  investigate why it is becoming more popular. \n\nSanjeev, most famous for his role as Navid in the BBC1 comedy Still Game, comes from a proud Sikh heritage, but is the only male member of his family not to wear the turban and sees this journey as a reconnection with the Sikh community. He starts off by looking into his own family history, how his turban-wearing brothers were bullied at school, and questions whether he was right to make the decision at the age of 14 not to wear one. \n\nAs a father of teenagers, Sanjeev tries find out whether attitudes towards the turban have changed over generations by meeting passionate young Sikhs in all walks of life. Over the course of his journey he discovers that, while many first-generation Punjabi immigrants wanted to try to fit in, their children and grandchildren are trying to stand out, and there is a resurgence of British Sikhs - both men and women - wearing the turban and reclaiming their identity. He also attempts to find out what lies behind this new-found enthusiasm to publicly embrace their religious identity.",
