They are there to celebrate the achievements of the Cefn Hengoed Majestics, a unique marching jazz band, by putting on a feast of barbecued chickens to feed the players and the community they support. With 100 people to feed, Sam and Shauna organise a spectacular cookout of grilled chicken in Alabama white barbecue sauce, hasselback potatoes, Louisiana macque choux and a rainbow slaw. Sam and Shauna have a week to teach the members of the band how to cook the dishes. They also have to make an enormous bespoke grill large enough to hold the chickens, and together with the community they build a massive firepit to cook them. Everyone gathers when it's all ready to eat the food and celebrate with their big cookout.",

In politics, we have had two female prime ministers, but the House of Commons and the National Assembly still have a majority of male elected members.\n\nMeanwhile, the row over the gender pay gap is hotting up daily, as Welsh businesses and public bodies publish their own statistics on pay, and some women band together to bring legal actions against their employers. And then there is the apparently neverending succession of sexual harassment allegations against leading figures in TV and movies.\n\nIn many key areas, Wales lags behind other parts of the UK in terms of women taking on senior roles in business, education or local government. So are we a more sexist nation?  \n\nBut there is plenty to celebrate too: the gender pay gap is narrowing, women are more visible in sport, industry, science and engineering, and men are playing a role in bringing up their children - something that would have been unthinkable 30 years ago never mind a century ago.\n\nThe programme hears from some of the women who have been at the cutting edge of social change - including Wales's first ever woman bishop - and those who feel that things are not changing fast enough. The programme also be looks at what happens behind closed doors in the Welsh family home. The statistics reveal that while men are doing more domestic tasks, it is still women who do the lion's share of the work on the home front, even when they themselves go out to work full time. Does that have to change before women can achieve equality in the workplace? Or do they actually prefer to take more of the responsibility? Is the Welsh mam alive and well in modern Wales? We hear from people who say women's traditional domestic role has been undervalued and many women would rather be at home with their children than out at work\n\nPlus reporter Steffan Powell presents all the key facts and stats and keeps an eye on what is being said on social media.",

They want to celebrate the team's promotion to the Welsh Premier League - not bad considering four years ago Barry Town FC were on the brink of extinction - and the work they do in the community. It is definitely something to celebrate and it needs a really big cookout, so Sam and Shauna decide to cook a whole pig, Hawaiian-style, in a huge brick firepit. The succulent pork will be served with pit beans, cornbread and an apple and fennel slaw, with fruit-filled toffee apples for dessert. But Sam and Shauna only have a week to teach the staff and players of Barry Town United how to make and cook the dishes. With help from a team of volunteers from the club, a pig-sized hole is dug in the beach, and 24 hours later the whole club gather to eat and celebrate with Sam and Shauna's Big Cook Out.",
