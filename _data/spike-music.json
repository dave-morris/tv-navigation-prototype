Josie d'Arby is joined by leading bassoonist Amy Harman at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire to bring highlights from the BBC Young Musician 2018 woodwind final.\n\nFive outstanding musicians have been selected, playing an array of instruments. They are: 18-year-old saxophonist Robert Burton from Cambridgeshire, from London, 17-year-old flautist Marie Sato, Francis Bushell, an 18-year-old bassoonist from Essex, the youngest competitor in these category finals, 14-year-old Eliza Haskins, a recorder player from Devon, and completing the line-up is 16-year-old clarinettist Tom Myles from County Down, Northern Ireland. They perform music from the Baroque period to the 21st century by composers such as Corelli, Faure and Gershwin.\n\nThe category finalists perform in front of an expert panel of judges: clarinettist Emma Johnson, herself a BBC Young Musician winner in 1984, Juliette Bausor, principal flautist with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and chair of the jury, composer, performer and writer Kerry Andrew. They will decide who will win the woodwind final and proceed through to the semi-final.\n\nThe programme includes profiles of the competitors, extensive highlights of their performances together with the behind-the-scenes story of the competition.\n\n2018 marks the 40th anniversary of BBC Young Musician. During this time the competition has showcased the brightest and best musical talent in the UK and this year is no exception. Throughout the series the aim for our musicians is to win through to the grand final where they will perform at Birmingham's Symphony Hall with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. Only one can claim the title BBC Young Musician 2018.",

Using feature film clips, rare archive and location filming, the programme examines how Afro-Cuban music has impacted - since early last century - on jazz, pop rhythms and dance styles. \n\nFrom Cuban rumba to New York mambo, Latin music enthralled 1950s America, challenging racial attitudes and changing the stereotypes projected in movies like West Side Story. It influenced Hollywood, TV sitcoms and 60s rock 'n' roll, as the Beatles and many American R&B bands absorbed Latin rhythms into the wider worlds of rock music, fashion and culture. \n\nFeaturing Carlos Santana, Cachao, Tito Puente, Dizzy Gillespie and the greatest names in Afro-Cuban music.",

In a pre-heavy metal world bands were experimenting with influences that dated back to 50s rock 'n' roll, whilst taking their groove from old-school rhythm and blues. It was also a time when men grew their hair long! \n\nIn a celebration of this era, we kick off with an early 1970s Badfinger number direct from the BBC library and continue the groove from the BBC vaults with classic rock 'n' roll heroes like Free, Status Quo, the Faces, Humble Pie and Mott the Hoople. Plus from deep within the BBC archives we dig out some rarities from the likes of Babe Ruth, Stone the Crows, The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Man, Heavy Metal Kids and original rockers Thin Lizzy... to name but a few.\n\nSit back and enjoy a 60-minute non-stop ride of unadulterated Totally British 70s Rock 'n' Roll!",

Plus it is the story of how Britain, as a nation, fell in love with ballet.\n\nUsing rare and previously unseen footage and interviews with dance icons such as Dame Gillian Lynne and Dame Beryl Grey, Bintley shows how the Sadler's Wells Ballet company survived an encounter with Nazi forces in Holland, dancing whilst the bombs were falling in the Blitz, rationing and a punishing touring schedule to bring ballet to the British people as an antidote to the austerity the country faced to emerge postwar as the Royal Ballet.",

It takes an unflinching and revealing look at what it actually took to be a jazz diva during a turbulent time in America's social history - a time when battle lines were being constantly drawn around issues of race, gender and popular culture.\n\nThe documentary tracks the diva's difficult progress as she emerges from the tough, testosterone-fuelled world of the big bands of the 30s and 40s, to fill nightclubs and saloons across the US in the 50s and early 60s as a force in her own right. Looking at the lives and careers of six individual singers (Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughan, Nina Simone and Annie Ross), the film not only talks to those who knew and worked with these queens of jazz, but also to contemporary singers who sit on the shoulders of these trailblazing talents without having to endure the pain and hardship it took for them to make their highly individual voices heard above the prejudice of mid-century America.\n\nThis is a documentary about how these women triumphed - always at some personal cost - to become some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, women who chose singing above life itself because singing was their life.",

"large": "In the early 1980s, Culture Club was one of the biggest bands in the world, selling 150 million records worldwide. Formed in London, the band was comprised of Boy George on vocals, Mikey Craig on bass, Roy Hay on guitar and keyboards and Jon Moss on drums. As well as their UK success, the band was huge in the USA - notching up ten top 40 hits. Being part of Band Aid cemented them as stalwarts of the 80s, a band that broke down barriers and left a huge legacy for the stars that came later, before they disbanded in 1986.  \n\nHowever, they are a band with a past as colourful as their music. George had a secret affair with his drummer Jon Moss and when they acrimoniously split, the band fell apart and George descended into heroin addiction. Over the years there have been numerous failed attempts to reunite the band.\n \nIn 2014 Culture Club decided to come back together to record a new album and embark on a UK and US tour. Director Mike Nicholls has unique access, following the band as they first meet in George's London home to write new material. However, it's not long before creative differences and tensions from their past begin to emerge. Faultlines develop further when the band travel to Spain to record the new album, spending two weeks working and living together in a remote recording studio. \n\nAs the band return to London to prepare for the tour, they suffer a Twitter mauling after their first big public performance on Strictly Come Dancing. Relations are even more strained when George and the band sign to separate managers and a sudden illness threatens the whole reunion. \n\nThe film looks at the band's troubled past, examining the themes of success, fame and ego, and reveals the personalities behind one of the most iconic bands of all time.",
