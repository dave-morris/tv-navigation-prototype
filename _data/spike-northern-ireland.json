And yet she sank in just 55 minutes - three times faster than Titanic. It's one of Britain's greatest untold disaster stories. Now on the 100th anniversary, presenters Kate Humble and Andy Torbet piece together exactly what happened in those 55 minutes.\n\nWhile Andy makes a dangerous dive to the wreck, Kate speaks to descendants of the survivors. The characters she uncovers include Violet 'Miss Unsinkable' Jessops, who survived both Titanic and Britannic, Captain 'Iceberg Charlie' Bartlett and lookout Archie Jewell, who miraculously survived while those around him died.",

The event led to major religious and political upheavals across Europe as Protestantism was born.\n\n\n\nTo mark the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, Dr Art Hughes examines the impact of Martin Luther and his ideas on the Gaelic-speaking peoples. In a journey that takes him from Rome, Germany and Geneva to the Outer Hebrides and across the island of Ireland, Art uncovers why the Gaelic-speaking areas of Scotland became, to a large extent, Protestant while most of Ireland remained Catholic. He shows how Luther's legacy still looms large over the Gaelic world.",
