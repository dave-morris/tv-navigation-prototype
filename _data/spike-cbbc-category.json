The results are shocking - just as well he's not supposed to go out. However, when Joe's electric runs out he's forced to leave the house to top up the card and dons a hat to hide the bad hair.\n\nAsha persuades Joe to go on a bus ride around London with her and Otis. For the first time in ages, Joe feels free. They have a fun day out and Joe decides it's time to tell Asha the truth - that his mum has been away all week but she's coming home soon.  \n\nBut when that day arrives, Joe's mum doesn't come home, and Joe starts to worry about her safety.",

Jas volunteers to help and eventually the girls decide inviting Matt round to dinner is the best plan, where Lily's nosy mum is bound to ask him outright. When teacher Mr Malone drops by and is invited in to join them, their carefully laid plans backfire. Meanwhile, Martha is obsessed with trying to be like her idol and head of the school council, Jade. She starts acting and dressing like her and joins every school society Jade belongs to in the hope of striking up a friendship. In the process, she puts Ollie's nose out of joint - he becomes jealous.",

As Chloe struggles to make sure no one sniffs out Mr Stink, and her dad tries to hide a secret of his own, the stage is set for an epic family confrontation. There is also one other person with an extraordinary secret, as it turns out that there is more to Mr Stink than meets the eye... or nose. \n\nMr Stink is a heartwarming, nose-clenching and funny tale which will appeal to viewers of all ages.",

The results are shocking - just as well he's not supposed to go out. However, when Joe's electric runs out he's forced to leave the house to top up the card and dons a hat to hide the bad hair.\n\nAsha persuades Joe to go on a bus ride around London with her and Otis. For the first time in ages, Joe feels free. They have a fun day out and Joe decides it's time to tell Asha the truth - that his mum has been away all week but she's coming home soon.  \n\nBut when that day arrives, Joe's mum doesn't come home, and Joe starts to worry about her safety.",
