Actor and comedian Sanjeev Kohli goes on a heartwarming personal journey to explore the importance of wearing the Sikh turban in Britain and  investigate why it is becoming more popular. \n\nSanjeev, most famous for his role as Navid in the BBC1 comedy Still Game, comes from a proud Sikh heritage, but is the only male member of his family not to wear the turban and sees this journey as a reconnection with the Sikh community. He starts off by looking into his own family history, how his turban-wearing brothers were bullied at school, and questions whether he was right to make the decision at the age of 14 not to wear one. \n\nAs a father of teenagers, Sanjeev tries find out whether attitudes towards the turban have changed over generations by meeting passionate young Sikhs in all walks of life. Over the course of his journey he discovers that, while many first-generation Punjabi immigrants wanted to try to fit in, their children and grandchildren are trying to stand out, and there is a resurgence of British Sikhs - both men and women - wearing the turban and reclaiming their identity. He also attempts to find out what lies behind this new-found enthusiasm to publicly embrace their religious identity.",

"large": "Long Night at Blackstone is Greg Hemphill's second outing as a director, and is the follow-up to his hilarious and terrifying West Skerra Light. Faye Bowers is the host of a low-rent paranormal activity show, a master of trickery and pretence, but she is desperate to be taken seriously as a journalist. When she learns that the show is to be axed, she is determined to go out with a bang. The venue for the final show is the mysterious Blackstone Manor, a huge dilapidated pile inhabited by the Laird of Blackstone and full of stories of past horrors. Though the filming day starts normally enough, it soon becomes apparent that all is not right, and for the very first time in the show's history, the ghosts may in fact be real and very dangerous. Battling backstabbing colleagues as well as the terrors in the house, Faye finds herself making a show that could catapult her career into the big league - if she can survive the night. \n\nStarring Lorraine McIntosh as Faye Bowers the presenter, John Gordon Sinclair as Pat Tomorrow the psychic sidekick, Julie Wilson Nimmo as Dom the Producer, John Michie as the Laird, and introducing a very special mystery guest.",

Quickly running out of willing instructors, the dreamboat that is Callum steps in. He is a qualified driving instructor and comes to the rescue with the promise of a lesson in a local car park.\n\nAlso trying to better their lot is Methadone Mick, who has enrolled in an online course that he doesn't want to reveal to anyone, for fear they'll laugh at him. The thing is, Mick doesn't have a computer under his bridge, so he relies on Isa, Jack and Victor's good will while he completes his studies. Pushed to their limits, Jack and Victor demand to know what the course is, while the answer reveals the sorry tale of Mick's father, which might go some way to explaining Mick's troubles.\n\nLater on, it's clear the romance between Isa and Callum is blossoming, but even though her husband died years ago, Isa is uneasy about the fact she still feels married, so she seeks advice on what to do for the best. Could this be a beautifully happy-ever-after ending for Isa?",

Has the training paid off? And how will they get the supercarrier out of the dockyard sea gate with only a few centimetres clearance either side? They will also have to sail her under the Forth road and rail bridges - no easy task when HMS Queen Elizabeth is taller than both.\n\nWith unprecedented access, this series - three years in the making - tells the behind-the-scenes story of what makes HMS Queen Elizabeth so unique and how her crew are working together to breathe life into Britain's biggest warship.",

Part travelogue, part spiritual quest, part artistic exploration, this series transports the viewer visually and emotionally as Lachlan challenges himself to capture the look and feel of the Holy Land and the Bible story.\n\nIn the first episode, Lachlan follows Jesus's last days on earth, travelling from the north of what is now Israel to Jerusalem. It's a pilgrimage that millions undertake and a story of love and suffering that has inspired some of the world's most remarkable masterpieces.\n\nFrom an early age, Lachlan was gripped by a vivid sense of the Holy Land, and especially the Easter story gleaned from the images in his illustrated children's Bible. As he grew up, those images were supplanted by others - the great masterpieces of Leonardo and Raphael, among others. Above all, Lachlan absorbed the Bible story through the many powerful paintings of the crucifixion by his own father, the artist Alexander Goudie. All these artists had one thing in common: they had never been to the Holy Land.\n\nLachlan has always wondered what it might be like to visit and paint the actual sites where the Bible stories took place. In this film, Lachlan explores the Holy Land for himself, sketching and painting the people and landscapes he sees there - looking afresh at its sacred sites and bustling streets, through the eyes of an artist. Exploring and sketching the key sites of Christianity that marked the end of Jesus's earthly life, will the experience of working and travelling in the Holy Land make him think about his own relationship with the Bible story?\n\nAlong the way, in a series of surprising encounters, Lachlan meets locals who have their own take on daily life in the Holy Land. This is personal odyssey for Lachlan, exploring the places his father painted but never saw, rooted in the past but brimming with life in the present day.",

He also examines the track record of initiatives such as the opening of the rail link between the Borders and Edinburgh and hears how infrastructure improvements are in the pipeline for parts of the north east network. In Newcastle, he checks on the progress of the manufacture of new rolling stock and catches up with transport minister Humza Yousaf.",

"large": "To celebrate the centenary of the Royal Air Force, Ewan and Colin McGregor take to the skies in some of the world's most iconic planes. These are the planes that were involved in aerial combat at every stage of the RAF's story, from the biplanes used in the early days of dogfighting in World War I to the beautiful Spitfire of the Battle of Britain, the plucky Lysander and on to mighty Vulcan nuclear bomber, as well as the Chinook helicopter and supersonic Typhoon that are still in service today.\n\nIt is a story of amazing machines and epic battles, but above all it is the story of the men and women whose courage and ingenuity have been at the heart of the RAF for 100 years. On their journey Ewan and Colin meet an amazing cast of characters. There is Geoffrey Wellum, who fought in the Battle of Britain as an 18-year-old and speaks with passion about what it meant to take on the might of the German air force. \n\nMary Ellis and Joy Lofthouse were two of the pioneering flyers of the Air Transport Auxiliary who delivered thousands of planes to frontline units in World War II. These two ladies share their memories of their glamorous but dangerous role.\n\nThen there is Fred Bailey, who was plucked from a clearing in the jungles of Burma by an intrepid RAF pilot just as the Japanese closed in on him, and also the band of brothers, the Bomber Boys, who brought devastation to German cities in their Lancaster Bombers night after terrifying night.\n\nTheir direct descendants were the Cold War aircrew like Jonny Tye and Martin Withers, who had the grim task of dropping the atom bomb and accepted their role knowing that, if they ever had to carry out their orders, it would be a one-way mission.\n\nWhile technology has changed with amazing speed, the need for bravery and coolness under fire has not. No-one displays these qualities better than David Morgan, who is the last RAF pilot to take part in a dogfight. He talks with chilling clarity about the day he shot down two enemy aircraft over the Falkland Islands but also with humanity about how he has had to live with the personal and emotional consequences ever since.\n\nFinally there are today's ground crew and pilots, who take Ewan and Colin on a supersonic flight in the Typhoon fighter as they make their own all-too-real preparation for deployment to the skies over Syria and Iraq.",
