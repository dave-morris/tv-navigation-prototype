As Isa and Callum get reacquainted, she has to fend off stiff competition, especially from one particularly persistent gooseberry.\n\nMeanwhile, Boabby decides it's time to get a car and learn to drive - but it doesn't come easily, and he soon terrifies the life out of anyone who takes him for a lesson. Quickly running out of willing instructors, the dreamboat that is Callum steps in. He is a qualified driving instructor and comes to the rescue with the promise of a lesson in a local car park.\n\nAlso trying to better their lot is Methadone Mick, who has enrolled in an online course that he doesn't want to reveal to anyone, for fear they'll laugh at him. The thing is, Mick doesn't have a computer under his bridge, so he relies on Isa, Jack and Victor's good will while he completes his studies. Pushed to their limits, Jack and Victor demand to know what the course is, while the answer reveals the sorry tale of Mick's father, which might go some way to explaining Mick's troubles.\n\nLater on, it's clear the romance between Isa and Callum is blossoming, but even though her husband died years ago, Isa is uneasy about the fact she still feels married, so she seeks advice on what to do for the best. Could this be a beautifully happy-ever-after ending for Isa?",

Conor is anxious to try progress things with Linda, so he puts his trust in Jock's strategy to get things moving, which involves a more direct approach than Conor expected. Maybe a touch of jealousy is what's needed to kick things off? This method leads to a comical encounter between Conor and Linda on the local park bench with several onlookers. Siobhan, meanwhile, is getting more than a little frustrated with Jock's antics. \n\nAfter the recent showdown between the lads, Mairead and the team of Principal Walsh and Sergeant Healy, Healy is feeling a touch of guilt and takes it upon himself to try make amends for what happened, with uncomfortable approaches leaving Mairead and Conor confused. Deciding to take a leap of faith with Linda, Conor and Jock crash a Walsh family barbecue. Principal Walsh's wife Orla is intent on her husband giving the lads a chance - they can't be all that bad, can they?

They suggest to both girls that they should spend one full day with them, all four together, on what they hope will be a beautiful adventure, so that the girls can see just what they're missing out on. If they don't want to hang out with them after this day, then the lads will give up pursuing them. The girls, sensing an opportunity to rid themselves of the lads once and for all, agree to the suggestion. A sick day from school is the only way they can do this, leading to various difficulties for all four. \n\nMeanwhile, Mairead decides to invite a 'friend' over for dinner, which doesn't go down well with Conor. The special day begins with a clash - the lads haven't told the girls what their plans for the day are, so the girls arrive dressed to impress - not appropriate clothing to cycle on borrowed bikes around Cork for the day. The idea to stop off at the river for a spot of swimming goes down like a lead balloon with the girls. But the lads think that they'll win them over with their swimming skills, which attracts more attention than they bargained for. Things take an unexpected turn when Jock is reminded that the day is a poignant anniversary date, leaving the foursome needing to rally together and be supportive. Jock's sensitive side makes Siobhan think twice about her feelings for him. As the long day continues, attitudes are changed and warmer feelings develop, to the surprise of all.",
