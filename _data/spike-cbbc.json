The results are shocking - just as well he's not supposed to go out. However, when Joe's electric runs out he's forced to leave the house to top up the card and dons a hat to hide the bad hair.\n\nAsha persuades Joe to go on a bus ride around London with her and Otis. For the first time in ages, Joe feels free. They have a fun day out and Joe decides it's time to tell Asha the truth - that his mum has been away all week but she's coming home soon.  \n\nBut when that day arrives, Joe's mum doesn't come home, and Joe starts to worry about her safety.",
