"large": "Living in treehouses and using stone tools, the Korowai were only discovered living in the jungles of West Papua around 40 years ago. Since then they have had to adapt rapidly to the ways of the outside world. Writer and adventurer Will Millard visits the Korowai four times over the course of a year, to see if he can get closer to them than is usually possible, to better understand the pressures they face as they leave the forest behind and transition into the modern world. He also wants to find out how much of their traditional hunter-gathering lifestyle still exists. What he finds shocks, surprises and confounds him, as he witnesses the last gasp of an ancient way of life which once defined us all.\n\nWill returns for his second trip to the Korowai to spend more time with Haup (White Beard) and Halap. They are some of the last remaining Korowai still living permanently in a treehouse without any real contact with the outside world. When Will first meets them, their adopted son August is there with them in the forest and his wife Amel gives birth one night, cutting her own umbilical cord with a sharpened piece of wood. But it soon turns out that they spend most of their time in the government-sponsored villages six hours walk away, and have decided to come to the treehouse to see if they can work with the film crew. So Will asks them to return to their government-built village, preparing to spend 10 days living with Haup and Halap alone in the middle of the forest.",

To take the prototype warship to sea for the first time on dangerous make or break sea trials in the North Sea.\n\nBefore sailing, the crew have to undergo rigorous fire and flood training, but suddenly they are faced with the real thing. Has the training paid off? And how will they get the supercarrier out of the dockyard sea gate with only a few centimetres clearance either side? They will also have to sail her under the Forth road and rail bridges - no easy task when HMS Queen Elizabeth is taller than both.\n\nWith unprecedented access, this series - three years in the making - tells the behind-the-scenes story of what makes HMS Queen Elizabeth so unique and how her crew are working together to breathe life into Britain's biggest warship.",

It was a time that transformed the way people think, work and play forever.\n\nHe traces the unprecedented explosion of new ideas and technological inventions that transformed Britain's agricultural society into an increasingly industrial and urbanised one. The documentary explores two fascinating questions - why did the industrial revolution happen when it did, and why did it happen in Britain?\n\nProfessor Black discusses the reasons behind this transformation - from Britain's coal reserves, which gave it a seemingly inexhaustible source of power, to the ascendency of political liberalism, with engineers and industrialists able to meet and share ideas and inventions. He explains the influence that geniuses like Josiah Wedgewood had on the consumer revolution and travels to Antigua to examine the impact Britain's empire had on this extraordinary period of growth.",

Julia Hardy looks at the games that imagine a new tomorrow, and speaks to the experts to find out if fantasy could eventually become reality.\n\n\n\nJulia ventures into the many future worlds that video games have predicted for humanity – from sci-fi dystopias and ruined remnants of our contemporary civilisations, to more optimistic and hopeful scenarios, where people benefit from technological advances and augmentations, and even invite A.I. assistants into our homes.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to games journalists Tamoor Hussain and Alice Bell, Julia discovers how games developers have mined the rich resource of a sci-fi future for inspiration. She meets Anthony Steed, Professor in Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics at UCL, to determine just how likely these futures could be. Will androids walk among us, blending into the crowds of any modern metropolis? Will schools use VR for time-travelling history lessons? Will we all be wearing full-body exoskeletons to mimic 'real life' touch sensations when we play games?\n\n\n\nJulia also meets the cast of Steven Spielberg’s new movie Ready Player One, as well as the director himself, to talk about their favourite future-set video games. She finds out if the massive online virtual reality world the film is set in, The OASIS, is something they can imagine happening in the near future. After all, gamers already play online for millions of hours per year – what’s really stopping us from spending even more time interacting in a digital space, rather than a physical one?\n\n\n\nIs it all doom and gloom? Or will the next technological age enrich humankind, and the human condition? As Julia quickly realises: there’s a lot more to virtual reality and advanced A.I. than simple fun and games.",
